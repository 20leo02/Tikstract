# Tikstract
Given a TikTok video consisting of still frames of Spotify songs, this project reverses, mutes, and deletes similar frames using FFmpeg, 
extracts the song title and artist using a trained Tesseract OCR, 
and allows the user to create a playlist with the extracted songs in Spotify.

Currently undergoing development as a web application under the domain name tikstract.com (not yet opened)
